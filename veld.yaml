    description: "transformed NER data from APIS. 'Uncleaned' means that the indices of the
      annotated entities sometimes are slightly off, and lose something of the word or take in
      whitespaces. This can be a problem with spaCy which is very strict on token boundaries.  For
      the cleaned data, the indices of the uncleaned data were corrected to match precise token
      boundaries.  Redundancies and overlaps were removed."
